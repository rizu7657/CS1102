## Unit 2 Discussion
The examples contain a loop with their intended use cases along with 
equivalent loops. The first example contains a while loop that evaluates 
a condition and repeats the block of code until its complete and its advantage 
is to repeat a block of code for an unknown number of times such as user input,
however its disadvantage would be iterating through a list objects or a known amount.
The second example is the do-while loop that executes a block of code and then 
evaluates a condition and repeats the code until the condition is true. Its advantage
comes in when the code needs to be executed first before a condition is evaluated
such as when a value need to be altered first as part of the block of code and only then 
then the condition to be evaluated. The while and do-while have the same disadvantage
in that they are less suited for repeating a block of code for a specific amount of times, 
however its advantage is when a block of code should be executed before the condition 
is checked.
